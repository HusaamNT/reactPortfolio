          My upbringing in Birmingham, England during the height of the digital
          era, fostered a lifelong interest in computers. From a young age, I
          tinkered with hardware and explored different types of software. As I
          grew older, I also developed a passion for graphic design and gaming.

          When the pandemic hit, my reality was shaken, and I found myself
          seeking new ways to interact with the tech world. It was then that I
          decided to embark on a journey as a programmer, eager to expand my
          understanding and skills in this growing field.

          Although my coding journey is my most recent venture, it feels like a
          natural fit for me, given my strengths in logic-based subjects like
          mathematics. I've become familiar with various full-stack
          technologies, including HTML, CSS 3, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express.JS,
          and MySQL. I enjoy the logical nature of setting up the backend and
          connecting the front-end elements to the back-end. Adding function to
          form and seeing a project come to life as a result of my efforts is
          extremely satisfying.

          More recently, I've also started learning C# within Unreal Engine,
          which has been an exciting new challenge. With my graphic design
          abilities, love of gaming, and newly developed coding skills, I see
          exciting opportunities to integrate these passions into a single
          package. By exploring new areas of the tech world, I hope to continue
          developing my programming skills and discovering new opportunities for
          growth and creativity.
